## Ticket Lifecycle Stages

**1. Ticket Creation:**

An end user submits a ticket about an issue (via portal, email, or call).

**2. Ticket Intake:**

The ticket is received and logged in the system. Initial default properties are set (priority, department, etc.).

**3. Ticket Categorization & Assignment:**

A help desk agent reviews the ticket, updates the category/help topic, sets urgency/severity, and assigns it to themselves, another agent, or a specific team/department.

**4. Initial Communication:**

The agent may contact the end user for clarification or more details.

**5. Ticket Work / Troubleshooting**

The agent investigates and attempts to resolve the issue, documenting actions and updates in the ticket.

**6. Escalation (if needed):**

If the issue is complex or out of scope, the agent escalates the ticket to a higher-level team or specialist.

**7. Resolution:**

Once the problem is fixed, the agent communicates the solution to the user and updates the ticket status to “Resolved.”

**8. Closure:**

The ticket is officially closed, completing the lifecycle.
